# Parasol Insurance - Node.js App

A [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) + [React](https://react.dev/) AI app for managing fictitious insurance claims. 

![App](./sample.png)

## Pre-requisites

- Node.js 18 or later -- Get it https://nodejs.org/en/download .
- npm 10+ -- Node.js includes npm
- An OpenAI-capable LLM inference server. Get one here with [InstructLab](https://github.com/instructlab/instructlab)!

## Configuration

You can change the coordinates (host/port and other stuff) for the LLM and backend by creating a [`.env`](.env) in the root of this repo and adding the following:

```
OPEN_AI_AP_KEY = 'EMPTY'
AI_MODEL_TEMPERATURE = 0.9
AI_MODEL_NAME = 'mistral'
AI_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:8000/v1'
PORT = 8005
```

## Running

First, get your inference server up and running. For example, with [InstructLab](https://github.com/instructlab/instructlab), the default after running `ilab serve` is that the server is listening on `localhost:8000`. This is the default for this app as well.

The frontend and backend are in separate repositories and should be structured as follows:

```
.
├── parasol-insurance
└── parasol-insurance-nodejs
```

### Clone the WebUI

First clone the webui from here:

```
git clone https://github.com/rh-rad-ai-roadshow/parasol-insurance.git
```

Switch to the email feature branch:

```
git checkout -b email-feature-branch
```

### Build the WebUI

In the Node.js Application Repo(this repo) run the `buildui` npm script

```
npm run buildui
```

### Run the Node.js Application

Then run the node.js app:

```
npm install
node server.mjs
```
App will open on `http://0.0.0.0:8005`.

Open the app, click on a claim, click on the chat app, and start asking questions. The context of the claim is sent to the LLM along with your Query, and the response is shown in the chat (it may take time depending on your machine's performance).
